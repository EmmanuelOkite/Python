#syntax about variable names in python
#a name given to a partition through programming is called a variable
num1 = 65 #num1 is a variable
num2 = 100 #num2 is a variable
print(num1)
print(num1+num2)
#the name of the variable should not start with a numeral or a number eg 1num 0r 2num
#the name of the variable should not start with a special character eg @num, #num, !num
#compound variable names should not have spaces eg num 1, num 2, my num
#compound variable names should be joined by either an underscore or camel case or camel notation eg my_num, num_1, myNum
#avoid using capital letters to begin the variable name eg Num1, Num2
#don't use special words as variable names eg print, input, for etc
